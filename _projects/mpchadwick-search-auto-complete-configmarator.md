Mpchadwick_SearchAutocompleteConfigmarator is a Magento extension I built that enhances the functionality of Magento's out-of-the-box search autocomplete functionality.

It adds a few key features that are missing...

- On/off switch
- Result limit
- On/off switch for result count
- SQL `LIKE` match position

All these features can be configured through the admin panel (hence the "configmarator" name).

I was inspired to build this based on actual frustration I saw merchants having with the OOB functionality (especially the inability to control the result limit)
